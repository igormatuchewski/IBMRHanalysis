# IBM RH Unsatisfied Employees Analysis

Hi guys, how are you doing?

That is my second published Python Project!

I used the same libraries that in the Brasileirao Project and in that I made it all in English, like the dataset.

Talking about dataset, I taked in Kaggle, link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data

I made a more powerful and complete dashboard with more filters and graphics using Pandas, Plotly Express and Streamlit, just to practice and learn more about Data Analytcis with Python!

I simulated a real life problem, so you can read and explore more my project in the link below:
